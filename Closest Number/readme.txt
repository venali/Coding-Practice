Given two integers n and m. The problem is to find the number closest to n and divisible by m. If there is more than one such number, then output the one having the maximum absolute value.

Examples :

Input: n = 13 , m = 4
Output: 12
Explanation: 12 is the Closest Number to 13 which is divisible by 4.
Input: n = -15 , m = 6
Output: -18
Explanation: -12 and -18 are both similarly close to -15 and divisible by 6. but -18 has the maximum absolute value. So, Output is -18
Input: n = -6 , m = 39
Output: 0
Constraints:
-105 <= n, m <= 105
