Print number pattern

You are given a number n. You need to generate and print a pattern based on the given value of n.

For each row, starting from the first, print numbers in descending order from n down to 1.
Each number in a row is repeated as many times as the current row index (starting from n).
Instead of printing each row on a new line, separate rows with -1.
Instead of a newline at the end of each row, print -1 to indicate row separation. After printing the entire pattern, end the output with -1.

For n= 3,
pattern:  3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1
                    3 3 2 2 1 1 
                    3 2 1

For n= 2,
pattern:  2 2 1 1
                    2 1

Examples :

Input: 2
Output: [2, 2, 1, 1, -1, 2, 1, -1]
Input: 3
Output: [3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, -1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, -1, 3, 2, 1, -1]
Input: 1
Output: [1, -1]
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 40
